use_model.py
 This script saves the use_embedding to file
 
 sbert_model.py
 This script saves the sbert_model to file
 
 sbert_encode.py
 This script encodes the questions into vectors and saves the encodings to file
 
 use_query
 This script generates the similarities of all the queries with all the questions in corpus(based on the use_model) and saves this as 2d numpy array to file
 
 sbert_query
 This script generates the similarities of all the queries with all the questions in corpus(based on the sbert_model) and saves this as 2d numpy array to file
 
 final_query.py
 This is the script that can be used to check outputs of any query in the test dataset. It prints the test query's title, and the title of top N similar questions.
 
 accuracy.py
 This script finds the accuracy of our model. Input- The similarity 2d numpy arrays generated by both the models. It then combines the similarities and finds the accuracy.
 
 use_model_accuracy.py
 This script finds the accuracy of only the use_model
 
 sbert_model_accuracy.py
 This script finds the accuracy of only the sbert_model
 
 answer_query.py
 This script is the one that will answer top N similar questions for an input new query(input by the user)
 
workflow
1. build the use_model and use_embedding
2. build the sbert_model and sbert_embedding
3. generate the similarity 2d numpy array
4. Find the accuracy using the 2d numpy similarity arrays
5. use both the embeddings and answer a new query


MAIN TASK
Run the final_query.py file on all the queries assigned to you. 
Change the query_number one by one and look at the top 7 similar questions generated.
If you feel that some question among those 7 is really very similar (duplicate) to the query (whose title is also printed in the output) and is not already the duplicate of the query, add the ID of that question to the originalquesid field of the csv.
If you feel that top 7 are not very similar to the query do not do anything.

BE STRICT. IF ANY OF THE TOP 7 IS REALLY CLOSE TO THE QUERY IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WANTS TO SAY, ONLY THEN ADD THE ID TO THE CSV.
